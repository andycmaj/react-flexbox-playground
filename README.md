# react/cjsx/less/react-hot-reload

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:brumm/webpack-coffee-react-less-base.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:8080
```

borrowed heavily from [KyleAMathews/coffee-react-quickstart](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/coffee-react-quickstart), but without all the sass/fonts/compass stuff
